# AI Co-Pilot Enhanced - Ankit Assignment BeyondChats

This project is an AI-powered customer support assistant designed to enhance the experience of support agents. It acts as a **Co-Pilot** that helps answer queries related to refunds, shipping, account issues, product info, returns, and technical support. It allows agents to interact naturally with an AI bot that pulls information from public articles and previous conversations to generate high-quality responses.
